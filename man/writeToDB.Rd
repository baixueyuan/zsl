\description{
Write the data.frame to MySQL database using the method that sent the query
to the database server.
}
\details{
The function can delete the records before writing to the database, however
if it can be make sure that the there is no duplicated records, the deletion
can be skipped, saving time. The deletion work is based on the primary key,
so the column index has to be given, and the column name should the same as
that in the database.

The mechanism of the function is to \strong{paste} an INSERT query and send to
the database server. Sum method seems safe to be executed.

The function \code{writeToSQL} just save the query to the \code{.sql} file,
which can be used to import to the database manually, however, this is a
good choice for the big data set.
